## Submitting your work

Deploying your finished app to Heroku by the homework deadline is part of the grading process. Even if you have code 
checked in that works properly, you will need to have a working deployment to Heroku to receive credit for the assignment.

Once you’re confident the functionality works correctly on Heroku, submit the URI of your deployed Heroku 
app in a text file named `rottenpotatoes-url.txt` with no other contents.

You don't need to check this file into your repo. You only need to submit this file to Gradescope for our autograder
to process.
