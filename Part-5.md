Deploying your finished app to Heroku by the homework deadline is part of the grading process. Even if you have code checked in that works properly, your team will need to have a working deploy to Heroku to receive credit for the assignment.

Once you’re confident the functionality works correctly on Heroku, submit the URI of your team's deployed Heroku app in a text file with no other contents. 

Please be careful to **use http and not https** for the autograder, that is, submit http://your-app.herokuapp.com and NOT https://your-app.herokuapp.com.
